# Advent of Code

Solving Advent of Code puzzles in Go and JavaScript. This repo is my learning lab for practicing problem solving, improving DSA skills, and recording my coding journey.

## Goals

- Solve Advent of Code every day
- Build solutions in Go and JavaScript
- Keep everything simple and readable
- Track progress in one place

## Structure

```
2025/
  go/
    day01/
      main.go
      input.txt
      sample.txt
    day02/
      ...
  js/
    day01/
      index.mjs
      input.txt
      sample.txt
    day02/
      ...
assets/
notes/
```

Each day has:
- a folder
- a solution file
- real input and sample input

## Run the solutions

### Go

```
cd 2025/go/day01
go run .
```

### JavaScript

Install once:

```
cd 2025/js
pnpm install
```

Run:

```
cd day01
node index.mjs
```

## Progress

| Day | Go | JS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 01  |     |     |
| 02  |     |     |
| 03  |     |     |

## Notes

I keep personal notes and thoughts in the notes folder. It contains explanations or things I learned while solving each problem.

# Advent of Code

Solving Advent of Code puzzles in Go and JavaScript. This repo is my learning lab for practicing problem solving, improving DSA skills, and recording my coding journey.

## Goals

- Solve Advent of Code every day
- Build solutions in Go and JavaScript
- Keep everything simple and readable
- Track progress in one place

## Folder structure

```
2025/
  go/
    day01/
      go.mod
      part1.go
      part1.txt
      part2.go
      part2.txt
      sample.txt
  js/
    day01/
      part1.mjs
      part1.txt
      part2.mjs
      part2.txt
      sample.txt
assets/
  banner.png
LICENSE
README.md
```

Each day includes:
- a folder
- a working solution
- real input and sample input

## Run solutions

### Go

```
cd 2025/go/day01
go run .
```

### JavaScript

Run:

```
cd day01
node part1.mjs
```

## Progress

| Day | Go | JS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 01  | ✅ | ✅ |
